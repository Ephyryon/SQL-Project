This is a bot that allows for inderect interaction with a supabase database. It can add to and remove from the tables in the database. It can also let you view any table by simply using the command !view table in a server with the bot. If you add the bot to a server you need to ensure that it has either a "Dev" role or "Admin" role to be able to interact with the bot. Might add a command that lets you specify what roles should grant access to the commands, but that's for the future.
